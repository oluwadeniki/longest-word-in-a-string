# longest-word-in-a-string
Day1girlcodechallenge
Explanation 
1.created a function Longestword with $sen as the parameter passed through it; i.e the user input
2. created a variable named string 1 which is the user input and replaces any character with a space , and used explode function to turn every string into an array
3. created another variable named string2 which is space..
then using the for loop as long as i is increasing ; 0 is less than the number of words from the user and it keeps increasing; 
4. using if statement cos the question states that it must not be empty..sen must not be empty stringlength of the user must be greater than space 
therefore space = user input 
then return space which i named string 2

then  i echoed longestword by reading the php file standard input (user input) and  fopen (opening the file and fget(getting the information from the userinput)
and pass it to the function
and prints out my result
